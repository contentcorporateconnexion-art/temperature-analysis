🌡️ Temperature Analysis Project (Pandas + NumPy)

This project demonstrates a simple Temperature Data Analysis using Python, Pandas, and NumPy.
It is beginner-friendly and perfect for learning the basics of data analysis, statistical calculations, and working with datasets in Python.

📌 Project Overview

This mini project analyzes temperature data recorded over 7 days and performs:

✔ Data Creation using Pandas

A temperature dataset is created with days of the week and corresponding temperature values.

✔ Statistical Analysis using NumPy

Mean (Average Temperature)

Maximum Temperature

Minimum Temperature

Standard Deviation (how spread out the temperature values are)

✔ Additional Analysis using Pandas

Temperature deviation from average

Categorization of each day into High or Low temperature

✔ Exporting Output

The final analyzed dataset is saved as a CSV file:

temperature_analysis.csv

📂 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy


📈 Sample Output
----- NUMPY ANALYSIS -----
Average Temperature: 30.14
Maximum Temperature: 33
Minimum Temperature: 28
Standard Deviation: 1.67

📦 Output File

temperature_analysis.csv (contains all analysis results)

🚀 How to Run

Open the notebook in Google Colab or run the script in any Python environment.

Make sure you have installed Pandas & NumPy:

pip install pandas numpy


Run the notebook or script.
